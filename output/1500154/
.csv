You also asked about contributions that were designated to the Primary but received after the date of the Primary election. These designations were due to a clerical error and an amendment has been filed to correctly designate them to the General Election.

You also asked about contributions that were missing during the 48 hour reporting period. Amendments have been filed to correctly reflect the dates these contributions were received. 

Finally, you asked about the joint fundraising committee Congressional Black Caucus PAC. This transfer was inadvertently reported from the wrong committee, it was from the CBCPAC-New Dem Fund for the Majority and the Statement or Organization has been amended to include this committee as an authorized representative. 

We hope this adequately answers your questions. If you have any additional questions, please contact the Committee.

Dr. Cameron Webb for Congress
